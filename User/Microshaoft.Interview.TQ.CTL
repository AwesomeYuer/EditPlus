18. How many Hub Transport servers must be installed in each Active Directory site where a mailbox server is located? Explain your answer.

Correct Answer:::
At least one. Multiple Hub servers can be installed in the same site to provide fault tolerance and load balancing. The Store Driver runs on Hub, the MailSubmission Service runs on the Mailbox role, these components talks RPC. To pick up messages from the clients outbox and to out messages to the Clients inbox a HT transport server is vital within the Mailbox Role site. No Message could be sent/received without the HT role 
19. In Exchange 2007/10, where are all queued messages stored? And what tool should you use to see messages currently stored in messaging queues?

Correct Answer:::
All Queues are stored in the Mail.que database. You should use the Queue Viewer to access messages in messaging queues. (PowerShell or EMC/MMC)

Correct Answer:::
? Upgrade the servers to Exchange 2007 SP1 or higher
? Use the Enable-ContinuousReplicationHostName cmdlet to configure the mixed network 
4. What are the 4 types of clustering available in Exchange 2007? How do they work?

Correct Answer:::
LCR (Local Continuous Replication)
? Utilises separate storage on same server
? Log shipping & seeding occurs on local server 
CCR (Cluster Continuous Replication)
? Separate server, separate storage
? Acts in Active/Passive configuration
? Log shipping & seeding between servers
? Can span multiple AD sites
? Relies upon Majority Node Set (MNS) from a File Share Witness (FSW)
SCR (Single Continuous Replication)
? A single copy of a CCR database
? Server doesn’t have to be clustered
? Can be used for ‘lagged’ copies of database
? Can be used to form a new CCR in a different AD site in a DR situation
SCC (Single Copy Cluster)
? The traditional method of clustering in 2000/3
? At least two servers in Active/Passive configuration
? One point of storage (usually a SAN) 
5. What are the benefits of a MNS (Majority Node Set)?

Correct Answer:::
? A two-node cluster can survive a single node failure. (Voter) 
? The arbitrator is not a member of the cluster. This is a benefit because it does not receive cluster and MNS heartbeat traffic. 
? Network connection to the arbitrator does not require a single subnet with the cluster nodes. 
? The arbitrator exposing the share can be a standalone server of a different OS architecture. For example, a 32-bit Windows server can provide a vote for an IA64 cluster. 
? One arbitrator can serve multiple clusters; however, each cluster requires a separate share 
6. What are some of the major architectural changes in message routing in Exchange Server 2007 compared to Exchange 2003?

? Removal of the linkstate table
? Removal of the MTA

? Routing Groups are no longer used
? Using AD site information to determine message delivery paths
? Having Edge in the DMZ 
7. Which feature in Exchange 2010 provides redundancy for messages while they are in transit?

Correct Answer:::
Shadow Redundancy. Exchange 2010 introduces the shadow redundancy feature to provide redundancy for messages for the entire time they're in transit. The solution involves a technique similar to the transport dumpster. With shadow redundancy, the deletion of a message from the transport databases is delayed until the transport server verifies that all of the next hops for that message have completed delivery. If any of the next hops fail before reporting back successful delivery, the message is resubmitted for delivery to that next hop 
8. What is FDS, where does it run, and what does it do?

Correct Answer:::
FDS runs on the Client Access Server and pulls the OAB files from the Mailbox server that generated the files

#T=应聘漂亮的回答
1、请你自我介绍一下自己好吗？
回答提示：一般人回答这个问题过于平常，只说姓名、年龄、爱好、工作经验，这些在简历上都有。其实，企业最希望知道的是求职者能否胜任工作，包括：最强的技能、最深入研究的知识领域、个性中最积极的部分、做过的最成功的事，主要的成就等，这些都可以和学习无关，也可以和学习有关，但要突出积极的个性和做事的能力，说得合情合理企业才会相信。企业很重视一个人的礼貌，求职者要尊重考官，在回答每个问题之后都说一句“谢谢”，企业喜欢有礼貌的求职者。
2、你觉得你个性上最大的优点是什么？
回答提示：沉着冷静、条理清楚、立场坚定、顽强向上、乐于助人和关心他人、适应能力和幽默感、乐观和友爱。我在北大青鸟经过一到两年的培训及项目实战，加上实习工作，使我适合这份工作。
3、说说你最大的缺点？
回答提示：这个问题企业问的概率很大，通常不希望听到直接回答的缺点是什么等，如果求职者说自己小心眼、爱忌妒人、非常懒、脾气大、工作效率低，企业肯定不会录用你。绝对不要自作聪明地回答“我最大的缺点是过于追求完美”，有的人以为这样回答会显得自己比较出色，但事实上，他已经岌岌可危了。企业喜欢求职者从自己的优点说起，中间加一些小缺点，最后再把问题转回到优点上，突出优点的部分，企业喜欢聪明的求职者。
4、你对薪资的要求？
回答提示：如果你对薪酬的要求太低，那显然贬低自己的能力；如果你对薪酬的要求太高，那又会显得你分量过重，公司受用不起。一些雇主通常都事先对求聘的职位定下开支预算，因而他们第一次提出的价钱往往是他们所能给予的最高价钱，他们问你只不过想证实一下这笔钱是否足以引起你对该工作的兴趣。
回答样本一：我对工资没有硬性要求，我相信贵公司在处理我的问题上会友善合理。我注重的是找对工作机会，所以只要条件公平，我则不会计较太多。
回答样本二：我受过系统的软件编程的训练，不需要进行大量的培训，而且我本人也对编程特别感兴趣。因此，我希望公司能根据我的情况和市场标准的水平，给我合理的薪水。
回答样本三：如果你必须自己说出具体数目，请不要说一个宽泛的范围，那样你将只能得到最低限度的数字。最好给出一个具体的数字，这样表明你已经对当今的人才市场作了调查，知道像自己这样学历的雇员有什么样的价值。
5、你对加班的看法？
回答提示：实际上好多公司问这个问题，并不证明一定要加班，只是想测试你是否愿意为公司奉献。
回答样本：如果工作需要我会义不容辞加班，我现在单身，没有任何家庭负担，可以全身心的投入工作。但同时我也会提高工作效率，减少不必要的加班。
6、如果通过这次面试我们录用了你，但工作一段时间却发现你根本不适合这个职位，你怎么办？
回答提示：一段时间发现工作不适合我，有两种情况：①如果你确实热爱这个职业，那你就要不断学习，虚心向领导和同事学习业务知识和处事经验，了解这个职业的精神内涵和职业要求，力争减少差距；②你觉得这个职业可有可无，那还是趁早换个职业，去发现适合你的，你热爱的职业，那样你的发展前途也会大点，对单位和个人都有好处。
7、谈谈你对跳槽的看法？
回答提示：①正常的“跳槽”能促进人才合理流动，应该支持。②频繁的跳槽对单位和个人双方都不利，应该反对。
8、工作中难以和同事、上司相处，你该怎么办？
回答提示：①我会服从领导的指挥，配合同事的工作。②我会从自身找原因，仔细分析是不是自己工作做得不好让领导不满意，同事看不惯。还要看看是不是为人处世方面做得不好，如果是这样的话我会努力改正。③如果我找不到原因，我会找机会跟他们沟通，请他们指出我的不足，有问题就及时改正。④作为优秀的员工，应该时刻以大局为重，即使在一段时间内，领导和同事对我不理解，我也会做好本职工作，虚心向他们学习，我相信，他们会看见我在努力，总有一天会对我微笑的。
9、你对于我们公司了解多少？
回答提示：在去公司面试前上网查一下该公司主营业务。如回答：贵公司有意改变策略，加强与国外大厂的OEM合作，自有品牌的部分则透过海外经销商。
10、最能概括你自己的三个词是什么？
回答提示：我经常用的三个词是：适应能力强，有责任心和做事有始终，结合具体例子向主考官解释，
11、你的业余爱好是什么？
回答提示：找一些富于团体合作精神的，这里有一个真实的故事：有人被否决掉，因为他的爱好是深海潜水。主考官说：因为这是一项单人活动，我不敢肯定他能否适应团体工作。
12、作为被面试者给我打一下分？
回答提示：试着列出四个优点和一个非常非常非常小的缺点（可以抱怨一下设施，没有明确责任人的缺点是不会有人介意的）。
13、你为什么要离开原来的公司?
回答提示：①回答这个问题时一定要小心，就算在前一个工作受到再大的委屈，对公司有多少的怨言，都千万不要表现出来，尤其要避免对公司本身主管的批评，避免面试官的负面情绪及印象。建议此时最好的回答方式是将问题归咎在自己身上，例如觉得工作没有学习发展的空间，自己想在面试工作的相关产业中多加学习，或是前一份工作与自己的生涯规划不合等等，回答的答案最好是积极正面的。②我希望能获得一份更好的工作，如果机会来临，我会抓住。我觉得目前的工作，已经达到顶峰，即]有升迁机会。
14、你欣赏哪种性格的人？
回答提示：诚实、不死板而且容易相处的人、有“实际行动”的人。
15、你通常如何对待别人的批评？
回答提示：①沈默是金，不必说什么，否则情况更糟，不过我会接受建设性的批评。②我会等大家冷o下来再讨论。
16、怎样对待自己的失败？
回答提示：我们大家生来都不是十全十美的，我相信我有第二个机会改正我的错误。
17、你为什么愿意到我们公司来工作？
回答提示：对于这个问题，你要格外小心，如果你已经对该单位作了研究，你可以回答一些详细的原因，像“公司本身的高技术开发环境很吸引我。”、“我同公司出生在同样的时代，我希望能够进入一家与我共同成长的公司。”、“你们公司一直都稳定发展，在近几年来在市场上很有竞争力。”、“我认为贵公司能够给我提供一个与众不同的发展道路。”这都显示出你已经做了一些调查，也说明你对自己的未来有了较为具体的远景规划。
18、对这项工作，你有哪些可预见的困难？
回答提示：①不宜直接说出具体的困难，否则可能令对方怀疑应聘者不行。②可以尝试迂回战术，说出应聘者对困难所持有的态度――工作中出现一些困难是正常的，也是难免的，但是只要有坚忍不拔的毅力、良好的合作精神以及事前周密而充分的准备，任何困难都是可以克服。
19、如果录用了你，你将怎样开展工作？
回答提示： ①如果应聘者对于应聘的职位缺乏足够的了解，最好不要直接说出自己开展工作的具体办法。②可以尝试采用迂回战术来回答，如“首先听取领导的指示和要求，然后就有关情况进行了解和熟悉，接下来制定一份近期的工作计划并报领导批准，最后根据计划开展工作。”。
分析：这个问题的主要目的也是了解应聘者的工作能力和计划性、条理性，而且重点想要知道细节。如果向思路中所讲的迂回战术，面试官会认为回避问题，如果引导了几次仍然是回避的话，此人绝对不会录用了。
20、你希望与什么样的上级共事？
回答提示：①通过应聘者对上级的“希望”可以判断出应聘者对自我要求的意识，这既上一个陷阱，又是一次机会。②最好回避对上级具体的希望，多谈对自己的要求。③如“做为刚步入社会的新人，我应该多要求自己尽快熟悉环境、适应环境，而不应该对环境提出什么要求，只要能发挥我的专长就可以了。
分析：这个问题比较好的回答是，希望我的上级能够在工作中对我多指导，对我工作中的错误能够立即指出。总之，从上级指导这个方面谈，不会有大的纰漏。
21、与上级意见不一时，你将怎么办？
回答提示：①一般可以这样回答“我会给上级以必要的解释和提醒，在这种情况下，我会服从上级的意见。”②如果面试你的是总经理，而你所应聘的职位另有一位经理，且这位经理当时不在场，可以这样回答：“对于非原则性问题，我会服从上级的意见，对于涉及公司利益的重大问题，我希望能向更高层领导反映。”
分析：这个问题的标准答案是思路①，如果用②的回答，必死无疑。你没有摸清楚改公司的内部情况，先想打小报告，这样的人没有人敢要。
22、为什么选择我们公司？
回答提示：曾经在报章杂志看过关于贵公司的报道，与自己所追求的理念有志一同。而贵公司在业界的成绩也是有目共睹的，而且对员工的教育训练、升迁等也都很有制度。
分析：去面试前先做功课，了解一下该公司的背景，让对方觉得你真的很有心想得到这份工作，而不只是探探路。
23、谈谈如何适应办公室工作的新环境？
回答提示①办公室里每个人有各自的岗位与职责，不得擅离岗位。②根据领导指示和工作安排，制定工作计划，提前预备，并按计划完成。③多请示并及时汇报，遇到不明白的要虚心请教。④抓间隙时间，多学习，努力提高自己的政治素质和业务水平。
24、除了本公司外，还应聘了哪些公司？
回答提示：很奇怪，这是相当多公司会问的问题，其用意是要概略知道应徵者的求职志向，所以这并非绝对是负面答案，就算不便说出公司名称，也应回答“销售同种产品的公司”，如果应聘的其他公司是不同业界，容易让人产生无法信任的感觉。
25、你还有什么问题要问吗？
回答提示：企业的这个问题看上去可有可无，其实很关键，企业不喜欢说“没问题”的人，因为其很注重员工的个性和创新能力。企业不喜欢求职者问个人福利之类的问题，如果有人这样问：贵公司对新入公司的员工有没有什么培训项目，我可以参加吗？或者说贵公司的晋升机制是什么样的？企业将很欢迎，因为体现出你对学习的热情和对公司的忠诚度以及你的上进心。
26、如果你被录用，何时可以到职？
回答提示：大多数企业会关心就职时间，最好是回答“如果被录用的话，到职日可按公司规定上班”，但如果还未辞去上一个工作、上班时间又太近，似乎有些强人所难，因为交接至少要一个月的时间，应进一步说明原因，录取公司应该会通融的。
